# 1. The Range Riddle
# Objective:
# The aim of this assignment is to deepen your understanding of Python's range() function and its application in loops. You will correct a code snippet,
#  simulate moods for different days, and create a countdown timer.

# Task 1: Your Mood Today
# Write a program that prints off different moods for each day of the week. Create a list of moods such as "Happy", "Sad", "Energetic", and "Calm". Using the range() 
# function, loop through the days of the week and for each day, randomly select a mood from the list and print it. 
# Ensure that your program includes the use of the random module to select the mood.

# Example Outcome: An example output could be "On Wednesday, you were feeling happy." "On Thursday you were feeling sad."
days=["sunday","monday", "tuesday","wednesday","thursday","friday","saturday"]
mood=["angry","sad","happy","confused","frustrated","glad","rageful"] 
import random
for i in range(len(days)):
    print(i)
    day = days[i]
    moods = mood[i]
    print(f"On {day} you felt {moods}")
    
#     2. Double Scoop with Nested Loops
# Objective:
# The aim of this assignment is to practice using nested loops in Python. You will correct a nested loop code snippet, simulate a mood tracker, 
#and generate a multiplication table.

# Task 1: Your Mood Tracker
# Simulate a mood tracker that records your mood at three different times of the day (morning, afternoon, evening) 
#for each day of the week. Use nested loops to implement this: the outer loop should iterate over the days, and the inner loop should iterate over the times of the day
# For each time, randomly select a mood from a predefined list and print it.
# Example Outcome: An example would be "On Tuesday afternoon you were sad" "On Tuesday night you were happy" "On Wednesday morning you were tired"

import random
moods = ["Energetic", "Happy", "Sad", "Calm"] 
print(random.choice(moods))
weekdays =["monday","tuesday", "wednesday","thursday"]
for i in range(len(weekdays)) :
    print(weekdays[i],random.choice(moods))
import random
moods = ["Energetic", "Happy", "Sad", "Calm"] 
print(random.choice(moods))
weekdays =["monday","tuesday", "wednesday","thursday"]
for i in range(len(weekdays)) :
    times = ["morning", "night", "afternoon"]
    print(weekdays[i],(random.choice(times)), "You were", (random.choice(moods)))
